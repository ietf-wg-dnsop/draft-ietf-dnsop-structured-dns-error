This was useful in the days of HTTP and in the days of non-REST APIs.  However now with HTTPS and applications using HTTPS APIs (\"REST APIs\"), such forging won't cause the web page to be displayed to the user.  The user running a browser will see an invalid certificate warning or the user will need to a priori install an additional trusted CA; both of those are bad. The user running an application will see who-knows-what error from the application; likely some message indicating failure to establish a secure connection. \r\n\r\nWe can expect such DNS servers to continue their behavior.  If they add support for EDE and also for Structured DNS error, they may (or may not) use \"Forged Answer\" in their EDE response.  Afterall, \"forgery\" sounds bad, right?  Although the RFC8914 error codes Blocked, Filtered, and Censored make it clear which entity caused the filtering, the RFC8914 \"Forged Answer\" does not.  Thus, it becomes the responsibility of the sub-error code to explain why a Forged Answer occurred.\r\n\r\nI propose that we define 3 sub-error codes, to be used only when the RFC8914 error is \"Forged Answer\", and those three sub-errors mimic the RFC8914 answers, with identical meaning:\r\n\r\n  Blocked\r\n  Filtered\r\n  Censored\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

IANA registry helps avoid the need to for an implementer to follow multiple documents to support this specification.
